# Hear-Periodic-Functions

This is the idea of a now project where I will build a script that recieves a cyclic function (in the fure any algebrical functiona that have an odd number of roots or whose limits to infinity tends to 0).

### The forethought
 - Recieves a mathemaical function, evaluates the function making sure that its "Hearable"
 
### The Algebraic situation

#### How to define a mathemaical function in python
 - How does it differs from regular algebra
